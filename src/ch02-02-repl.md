## REPL
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop and originates from programming language (Lisp (from 1950s)).
REPL read user input and executes the code and it repeats.

To start REPL just run AbleScript interpret:
```console
$ able-script

```

The `::` is a prompt, where you can write AbleScript code.
